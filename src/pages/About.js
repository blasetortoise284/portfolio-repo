                        <p>My name is BLASETORTOISE284, and I was born and raised in REDACTED! I am currently studying Computer Science on the design track at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and I’ve explored dance, public health, chemistry, biology, programming, and, most recently, user interaction and user experience design.</p>
                        <p>I consider myself a hands-on & curious person who’s especially passionate about using problem-solving and innovation in design to improve human experiences. Since I find it fascinating how differently people process information through various forms of organization and representation, I’m constantly on the lookout for opportunities to work on projects that center users in making complex things as easy to understand as possible.</p>
                        <p>Whether it be through putting together choreography in REDACTED workshops for dancers of all and any experience, working as a UIUX designer and researcher for REDACTED, and co-leading the REDACTED team for REDACTED, I am always learning and designing through endless mediums. Particularly as a designer, I enjoy working on tangible solutions end-to-end and seeing ideas come to fruition in development. </p>
